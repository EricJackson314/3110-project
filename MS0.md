We will meet via Zoom on Tuesdays, and Thursdays at 11:00AM EST and Saturdays at 12:30 EST.

## Proposal

### Summary
We will design a Linear Algebra library, which we will use to implement image compression and the Eigenfaces algorithm.

### Key Features
1. Linear Algebra Library
2. ```.img``` Parser 
3. Image Compression
4. Eigenfaces

### Description
Our goal is to design a robust and efficient linear algebra library, including methods for matrix multiplication, diagonalization, computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, computing null-space and column-space, row reduction, and so on. We will use this library to perform image compression and eigenface analysis. Performance on these tasks will measure the efficiency of our implementation. We plan to use pictures of Cornell CS Faculty for both the image compression, as well as the Eigenface algorithms.
